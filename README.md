# FloatplaneFullSize

Chrome Extension to make Floatplane Full Size (But not fullscreen)

To Install
Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.

I'd put it in the Chrome store but it costs money ;)
